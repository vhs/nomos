<h3>Entry</h3>
<p>To enter the main door, first enter the VHS suite number: <strong>104</strong>. This is also written on the directory beside the keypad.<br>
    There will be a prompt to enter your pin. You don&#039;t have to wait for the prompt to finish talking. Your pin can be changed by you, and is written in your profile page.  The door will click unlocked, and you can enter.<br>
    The code for the inner door has not changed. Enter this code, then turn the thumbturn toward the hinges.<br><br>
    All together: <strong>104</strong>, then YOUR PIN, then the old VHS pin for inside.<br><br>
