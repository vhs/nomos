<h3>Entry</h3>

<div ng-show="pin == null">
    <p>You must set a PIN before you can access the space. Click the generate PIN on your <a ui-sref="user.profile">profile page</a> and set your desired PIN code. Keep it safe.</p>
</div>


<div ng-if="currentUser.hasPrivilege('vetted') && pin != null">
    <p>Our RFID access system is happening, but will take a bit longer to get installed and tested, in the meanwhile we have setup a temporary access system so keyholders can come in and help set the new space up.</p>

    <h4>When entering</h4>

    <p>Access is via the front door on Venables street. The lock is the same as at Cook so just pretend you are in the hallway. The new code is <strong>{{innerdoor}}</strong>.</p>
    <p>The “is VHS open bot” is now located on the admin cabinet by the small office in the main area if you would like to open the space to non keyholders.</p>
    <br />
    <p><b>To open</b>, punch in the current door access number: <strong>{{innerdoor}}</strong></p>
    <p>The lock is now unlocked and you can turn the thumbturn clockwise to unlock the door.</p>
    <br />
    <p><b>NOTE:</b> Due to issues with the lock, when locking the door after you enter, you'll need to close it, then open it and then close the lock again. This will make sure that the front door lock will actually be in a locked position.</p>

    <h4>When leaving</h4>
    <p>
        <b>Ensure all doors are locked:</b> this means:
        <ul>
            <li>the front door,</li>
            <li>the side door (locked with a deadbolt),</li>
            <li>the rear sliding doors which are locked with bars into holes in the concrete and a cross bolt between the two doors</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>Failure to do so may result in mass theft of stuff from the hackerspace and general sadness followed by the collapse of the society.</p>
    <p><b>Turn down the heat</b>, setting it to 15 works. (panel beside the furnace room)</p>
    <p><b>Turn off the lights</b>, there are two switches beside the sliding doors in the woodshop, and you have to throw two breakers on the east workshop panel, the a switch by the base of the side door stairs, and a series of switches in the upstairs rooms.</p>
    <p><b>Lock the front door behind you.</b> To lock, press the centre button labeled “Schlage” to engage the knob that turns the deadbolt or use your code and you are good to go. Then give the door a try to make sure its locked.</p>
    
    <h4>Exit</h4>
    <p>To lock the inner door after you have left, press the Schlage button on the top, then rotate the thumbturn (counter-clockwise) away from the hinges.</p>
    <p>Please test the door to confirmed that it is closed and locked properly.&nbsp;</p>
