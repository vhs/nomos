Here's how you do it:
<br />
The code for this web app (Membership Manager Pro) is here:
<br />
<a href="https://github.com/vhs/membership-manager-pro">https://github.com/vhs/membership-manager-pro</a>
<br />
It is a private repo, so you will need to be added to the VHS account.
<br />
Contact Jarrett, Funvill, or Garthomite on the forums to get access.
<br />
Check the <a href="https://github.com/vhs/membership-manager-pro/wiki">GitHub wiki</a> for instructions on how to get started.
 MMP testing is done with a Vagrant file that automagically sets up a test VM with the proper settings.
<br />
To coordinate development, get on #mmp on Slack (a kind of web-based IRC that is amazing).
Message the above people to get invited.
