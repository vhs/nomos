# This configuration was automatically generated from a CircleCI 1.0 config.
# It should include any build commands you had along with commands that CircleCI
# inferred from your project structure. We strongly recommend you read all the
# comments in this file to understand the structure of CircleCI 2.0, as the idiom
# for configuration has changed substantially in 2.0 to allow arbitrary jobs rather
# than the prescribed lifecycle of 1.0. In general, we recommend using this generated
# configuration as a reference rather than using it in production, though in most
# cases it should duplicate the execution of your original 1.0 config.

        # The following configuration line tells CircleCI to use the specified docker image as the runtime environment for you job.
        # We have selected a pre-built image that mirrors the build environment we use on
        # the 1.0 platform, but we recommend you choose an image more tailored to the needs
        # of each job. For more information on choosing an image (or alternatively using a
        # VM instead of a container) see https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/executor-types/
