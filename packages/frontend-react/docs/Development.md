## Components

This project uses a variant of the "Atomic React" pattern to organize its components. In short, Atomic React breaks up components into different types(/folders) based on re-use and complexity.<br />
I.e. an _atom_ is a component of bare function where as a molecule in increasingly complex, and so on.

This project divides components based on complexity and the inclusion of other components and their respective complexity levels.<br />
I.e. a simple component that includes an _Atom_ or other components will always at least be a Molecule.

This project uses the following levels to achieve this:

- _Atoms_ are re-usable, simple one-off components
- _Molecules_ are fundamental building blocks
- _Particles_ offer more functionality
- _Composites_ are re-usable (template) components
- _Materials_ are fully re-usable complex modules/components

In addition to the "basic" components above, this project separates the following types of components:

- _Layouts_
- _Pages_
    - _Admin_
    - _Common_
    - _User_
- _App_
- _Providers_
- _Templates_

Furthermore, all components use a numbered naming convention to enforce consistent directory ordering:

- `src/components/00-components`
- `src/components/01-atoms`
- `src/components/02-molecules`
- `src/components/03-particles`
- `src/components/04-composites`
- `src/components/05-materials`
- `src/components/06-layouts`
- `src/components/07-pages`
- `src/components/08-app`
- `src/components/09-providers`
- `src/components/99-templates`

Barring templates, every type of component can be scaffolded by using the `pnpm create:_type_` command. <br />
E.g. `pnpm create:atom Logo` will create a template component by the name of `Logo` in `src/components/01-atoms/Logo`.

The basic page/route workflow consists of a `route` file (that extends a particular `layout`) which calls a `page` that includes all the relevant components.

## Source Code Organization

The sources are organized in the following folders:

- `src/components` is where all components live
- `src/lib` is where all other non-component code lives
- `src/routes` is where all routing files are kept
- `src/types` is where all supportive Typescript typing files reside

Additionally, the following files are relevant:

- `index.html` is the primary entry point for the application
- `src/main.tsx` is the primary JSX entrypoint
- `src/main.css` is the main CSS definitions file
- `src/router.tsx` provides routing scaffolding
